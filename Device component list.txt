----------------------------------------------
Current Hardware in the Sensor:
[doesn't matter as much since the components we add will act as a seperate system but would still be nice to list in proposal]
-uses a BLE (Bluetooth low energy module)
-pressure guage that detects up to 50 psi
-Uses a lithium Ion battery pack (Tadiran Utility Meter Li-Battery 3.6v)
- G 1/4 pressure connector
- housing: 304 stainless steel and high-impact polycarbonate
-
----------------------------------------------
Software that the sensor uses:
-has its own app called 'Pressure Pro app'
-once the device is setup within the app you are able to read 
pressures from the device and store the data locally on the device which has the application installed
or able to upload the data to 'Tranducers direct data portal cloud' which is a cloud based database which
can be used to store data 24/7 when connected to a network connection

It doesn't seem that we are able to make modifications to this application or make our additional components work with the database
but we can still hook up and additional bluetooth connecter and our accelerometer to the power supply and have it send the 
accelerometer data on a seperate channel. 

-------------------------------------------

Hardware we intend to add:
BOSCH BMA400 accelerometer

BOSCH Bluetooth Tool Module (GCY42 BluetoothÂ® Tool Module)
----------------------------------------------
Modifications to software (if possible):

Like previosuly stated we arent going to be able to make modifications
to the Pressure pro app and send the data from the accelerometer through that application
so we will need an additional channel to send this data to, which is why we will need to make use
of an additional bluetooth connector from Bosch

To do so we will make use of the 'free Bosch Toolbox mobile app'
-device has 100 ft of connectivity
